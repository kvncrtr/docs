# Home Depot

**History** Self-reliance. Resilience. Tireless optimism. These are the traits of our customers. We built The Home Depot for them, to provide them with the products, services and knowledge they need to create the homes of their dreams. Decades later, they’re still the No. 1 reason we wear the orange apron. Our story, now almost 40 years in the making, is also theirs.

Bernie Marcus and Arthur Blank dreamed up The Home Depot from a coffee shop in Los Angeles in 1978. Avid DIYers, they envisioned a superstore that would offer a huge variety of merchandise at great prices and with a highly trained staff. Employees would not only be able to sell, but they would also be able to walk customers at every skill level through most any home repair or improvement.

From those two stores in Atlanta, Home Depot has grown to more than 2,300 stores in three countries, but in every store, our goal is the same: to earn our customers’ respect by offering the highest level of service, the broadest selection of products and the most competitive prices. As Marcus says in his and Blank’s book, “Built From Scratch,” “At the end of the day, we’re in the people business.”

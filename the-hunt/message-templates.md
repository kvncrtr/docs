### **2. Found the developer/engineer**

Hey [name],

I hope your day is going great so far. I noticed [**Think about how you first came across that person, or something you both have in common - went to the same college, working on the same opensource project, etc**] and was inspired to reach out. I’m reaching out because I’d love to learn more about your journey in tech, and I’d appreciate any insights you might be able to share as I prepare for my job search. Would you be open to a virtual coffee chat? 

Wishing you a wonderful [**current time of week**]!
Cheers,

Plan to send a thank you note 24-48hrs after meeting with someone. Whether it is a coffee chat, an interview, a technical, etc. For some people it’s really important:

Hi [Name], 

Thank you so much for taking the time to chat with me yesterday. I really liked when you shared about [personalize it - what did you learn during your conversation?]. I will definitely stay in touch! If there’s anything I can do to help you, please let me know.

**THANK YOU AFTER AN INTERVIEW**

*Hi [First Name]*

*Thanks for taking the time to jump on a call with me today. It was great to learn more about [Company Name]. It was nice to hear how  [x, y, z, make sure to personalize it]. I’m excited about the potential opportunity to join [Name of Company] as a [Title of the position]. What would be the next step?*

*Thank you,*

You can also use a thank note as an opportunity to share why you are excited about the opportunity or as a way to clarify something you said during the interview.

Example 2 

*Hi [First Name]*

*Thank you for taking the time to interview me today. I really enjoyed our white-boarding time and the feedback that I received from you. I will make sure to work on explaining the detail of my project better. I thought more about how I would solve the code challenge and wanted to share two solutions I thought about (see below).*

*[Code]*

*I believe these are both valid solutions.  [Feel free to add more so they can understand your thought process. For example:  In terms of performance and efficiency, I think they are pretty even as they both at their worst are 0(N) in terms of time complexity.] What do you think?*

*Once again, thank you for your time today. I will be following with [point of contact to hear more about next steps].*

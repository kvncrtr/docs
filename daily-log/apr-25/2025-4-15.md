# Recap

1. **What I learned?**

   Today I deepened my understanding of PostgreSQL best practices for job readiness, including schema design, security, indexing, and migrations. I learned how to create Anki flashcards from documentation, how to structure spaced *revision* (not repetition) in Notion based on mastery, and how to stay off my phone during study time while still being reachable for important calls. I also explored a practical mental model for learning concepts like `SERIAL` in PostgreSQL by breaking them down into what, when, where, how, trade-offs, and alternatives.

   On top of that, I created a personalized deep dive framework that I can reuse for any CS or programming concept â€” complete with sections for gotchas, performance, and teaching others. I also learned the difference between what should go into Anki (for memorization) versus Notion (for reference), and how to format Markdown for clean use in Notion. All of this builds toward becoming more intentional and effective in learning and preparing for full-stack interviews.

2. **What I've Completed?**

   -- Converted PostgreSQL best practices into Anki and Markdown formats  
   -- Built a reusable Notion deep dive template  
   -- Clarified phone focus settings for distraction-free studying  
   -- Documented learning strategy for deeper retention

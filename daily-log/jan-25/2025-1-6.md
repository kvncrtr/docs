   - createBrowserRouter: In React Router, createBrowserRouter is a function used to create a router object that manages the navigation and routing logic in your web application.  
      - Purpose: It's the recommended way to define your routes in React Router v6 for web applications.  

      - Benefits: Declarative Routing: You define your routes using a clear and concise syntax, making them easier to understand and maintain. Data Fetching: You can easily integrate data fetching logic into your routing, ensuring that the necessary data is loaded before a route is rendered. 
      
      - Nested Routes: You can easily create nested routes, allowing you to structure your application's navigation in a hierarchical manner. 
      
      - Error Handling: You can handle errors that occur during navigation or data fetching, providing a better user experience.

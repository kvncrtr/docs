# Recap
**What did you learn today?**

- GitHub Actions is a workflow automation service by GitHub, to automate all different types of processes and actions offers various automations around the code that’s stored on the remote repository.

- there are two main areas in automation that can be focused on. that’s continuous integration and continuous delivery.

- *continuous integration*: code changes are automatically built, tested, and merged with existing code.

- *continuous delivery:* after integration, new app or package version are published automatically.

- GitHub Actions makes setting up these automations very easy and manageable.

1. **What did I do yesterday?**

   - took off and studied go recievers and go syntax

2. **What will I do today?**

   - work on AG.

3. **Are there any blockers?**

   - dealing with a data inconsistency, when an input is entered an id the database should auto increment the id to the next value but the next value arent the immediate numerical value sometimes the database skips from one to nine for an example.

# Recap 
**What I learned today.** 
   - [Fix a sequence when it goes out of sync in Postgres](https://dev.to/arctype/how-to-fix-a-sequence-when-it-goes-out-of-sync-in-postgres-480b)
   -postgres sequence is nothing but a number generator. so you have to force set the value to the current highest value in th column not set the next value of the sequence. 

   ```
   SELECT SETVAL('public."Users_id_seq"', COALESCE(MAX(id), 1)) FROM public."Users";
   ```

   Such query will update the Users_id_seq sequence by setting its current value to the result of ``COALESCE(MAX(id), 1)``.

   The ``COALESCE`` function returns the first non-null value, and it is required because if Users were empty, ``MAX(id)`` would return ``NULL``. So, by using ``COALESCE``, you are sure that the value assigned to ``Users_id_seq`` will be ``MAX(id)`` when ``Users`` is not null, and 1 when ``Users`` is null. In both cases, that query sets the desired value.

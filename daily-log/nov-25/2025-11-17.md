    ### **Action Steps**
    
    Study simple patterns:

    ## **HOUR 3 — CONTENT PERFORMANCE & BRAND HEALTH**
    
    This is 30–40% of the job.
    
    ### **Learn:**
    
    - **Digital Asset Management (DAM)**
    - **PIM (Product Information Management)**
    - **What makes content “good vs bad”**
    - How to evaluate a PDP quickly:
        - Is the title clear?
        - Are there enough images?
        - Are bullets benefits-focused?
        - Is it on-brand?
    
    ### **Practice Task:**
    
    Take ANY Home Depot product, evaluate it, and write:
    
    - 3 insights
    - 3 content fixes
    - Expected business impact
    
    This becomes an example for your interview.

    ## **HOUR 4 — SLIDE STORYTELLING FOR EXECUTIVES**
    
    40% of the job is *presenting insights*.
    
    ### **Learn:**

        - **Slide 2: Insights**
        - **Slide 3: Recommendations**
        - **Slide 4: Expected Impact**
    
    ### **Practice Task:**
    
    Take fake numbers and build a 3–4 slide deck.
    
    Use this formula:
    
    **Insight → Why it matters → What to do → Expected revenue lift**
    
    This is what they hire for.

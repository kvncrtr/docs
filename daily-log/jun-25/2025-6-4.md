# Recap

1. **What I learned?**

   -- I learned about how the ui-ux deliverables are associated wtih engineering planning in ScrumBan and product development.
   -- I created a ui first planning process to follow when developing that I have to follow each iteration. 1. create a user persona based on the epic 2. decide a journey map for this persona 3. gather all information needed to solve the persona’s problem. 4. create a user flow with FigJam 5. curate wireframes → mockups → prototypes 6. define a user story 7. list out all the product features (features + functions) 8. break those features into task
   -- I learned more about engineering planning.
   | **Level** | **Definition** | **Example from Your Daycare App** |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | **Epic** | A large body of work that can be broken down into features or stories. Usually tied to a core goal or theme. | `Enrollment Experience` or `Increase Website Traffic` |
   | **Feature** | A major component or functionality of the product. Often implements part of an epic. | `Enrollment Form`, `Parent Resource Center`, `Blog System` |
   | **User Story** | A specific action a user can take. Written from the user’s perspective. | “As a parent, I want to schedule a tour so I can visit the daycare.” |
   | **Task / Sub-task** | A technical or design action required to complete a story. | Create form validation logic, style CTA button, connect form to backend |

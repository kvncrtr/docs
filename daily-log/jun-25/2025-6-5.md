# Recap

1. **What I learned?**

   -- have a better placing on what goes in docs and what goes in figma and what goes in notion.
   -- revamped ui planning
   **1. Start with the Vision (UI-First Planning)**
   —Sketch or design the mobile UI in Figma.
   —Define features based on the UI, not the database
   —List features in plain language before coding
   1. create a user persona based on the epic in docs
   2. decide a journey map for this persona in docs
   3. gather all information needed to solve the persona’s problem in docs.
   4. create a user flow with FigJam in figma and export to docs
   5. curate wireframes → mockups → prototypes based on the user flow in figma and export to docs
   6. define a user story  in docs and notion
   7. list out all the product features (features + functions) in docs and notion
   8. break those product features into task in docs and notion
   -- for the wifrefames need to reflect the user flow and the mockups reflect the wireframes.

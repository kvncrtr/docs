“Along my job history there has been this still voice explaining to me what is woven in the fabric of my personality and my character. Before 2018 I truly didn’t understand what really drives pushes me beyond my abilities. Business was the word that I sung to but never really understood the why behind the lyrics. But in my music career, in my retail career, in my software engineering career they all sung in unison to the tune of ‘Business’. I'm starting to understand that the positions that I want to target and I know that I have been extremely successful in were positions where I pushed my limits and rose above others do to my understanding of how business operates and how they succeed”

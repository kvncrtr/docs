# What I Learned

-I learned how to Normalize a table to cut down on redundancy and improve data integrity The process involves breaking down large tables into smaller ones and establishing relationships between them. I had a large table that defined blogpost but certain fields inside the table for example citations involved over 12 different fields. So I created smaller tables for all fields that needed to be normalized. Afterwards I assigned relations between the tables but some were classified as a many-to-many relationship. So I learned how to create Join Tables, I wanted to create a many-to-many relationship between citations and blog posts.

-I learned that when optimizing queries in Go you have a decision to use `Prepare` or `exce/queryrow` based on operation needs. using `Prepare` is needed if you want to execute the same SQL query for multiple times with different parameters, `Prepare` can optimize performance by parsing the query once and then reusing the prepared statement. This is especially useful when executing a query many times in a loop or with varying data. When you prepare a query, the database server can optimize execution, particularly for complex queries or those involving a large number of rows. This reduces the overhead of parsing the query each time it’s executed. Some databases impose a limit on the number of prepared statements that can be open simultaneously. While this is unlikely to be an issue with a single insert, in applications with high concurrency and many prepared statements, it could lead to resource contention If you're inserting multiple posts Use `Prepare` to avoid re-parsing the query for each execution.

Notes:
Instagram, boasting over 2 billion users, is a powerhouse of innovation, and its success hinges on a robust and scalable architecture. Let's explore some key components:

Microservices Architecture: Instagram leverages microservices for independent, modular development. This enables flexible scaling of individual components based on demand.

Global Content Delivery Network (CDN): A robust CDN ensures fast and reliable content delivery for users worldwide. Caching frequently accessed data at geographically distributed edge locations minimizes latency and improves user experience.

Tech Stack Powerhouse: Instagram utilizes a diverse mix of technologies to handle various tasks:

Frontend: React (UI framework), GraphQL (API querying), Native mobile development with Swift (iOS) and Kotlin (Android)
Backend: Django (web framework), Gunicorn (web server)
Data Storage: Memcached (in-memory caching), PostgreSQL (relational database), Cassandra (NoSQL database for high-volume data), CockroachDB (distributed SQL database for scalability)
Messaging/Streaming: Apache Kafka (distributed streaming platform), Scuba (Facebook-developed messaging system)
Data Processing: Spark (large-scale data processing), Presto (ad-hoc SQL querying), Scuba (for internal data pipelines)
DevOps: Kubernetes (container orchestration), Docker (containerisation), ELK Stack (log management), Prometheus (monitoring)

**MAKE THE BLOG POST MORE ATTRACTIVE TO GOOGLE**

A **Blog Full-Stack Application** is an excellent project idea that can demonstrate both basic and advanced web development skills while also being something manageable to build and scale. Here’s how you can design and implement a blog application to showcase your full-stack abilities for landing a job at top tech companies like Google or Microsoft:

### Project Overview:

A blog application where users can:

- Create, read, update, and delete blog posts (CRUD operations).
- Register and log in with authentication.
- Comment on posts.
- View posts categorized by tags or categories.
- Manage a profile, including basic information and an avatar.

### Key Features:

1. **User Authentication**:
    - **Sign up and login**: Implement user registration and login (using email/password, social logins like Google or GitHub).
    - **Role-based access**: Allow users to have different roles (Admin/Editor/Viewer) with different permissions (only admins can delete posts, for example).
2. **Blog Post CRUD**:
    - **Create/Update/Delete Posts**: Admin or authorized users can create, update, and delete blog posts.
    - **Markdown Support**: Allow users to write blog posts using Markdown for rich-text formatting.
3. **Comment System**:
    - Users can add comments to blog posts.
    - Include features like upvoting/downvoting comments or flagging inappropriate comments.
4. **Categories & Tags**:
    - Implement categories and tags for blog posts.
    - Enable users to filter or search posts by categories or tags.
5. **Search Functionality**:
    - Full-text search for blog posts by title, content, or tags.
6. **Profile Management**:
    - Users can update their profile (name, avatar, bio) and view their own posts.
7. **Responsive Design**:
    - Ensure the front-end is mobile-responsive and follows modern UX/UI principles.

### Technology Stack:

### **Front-End**:

1. **React.js** or **Vue.js** (for building dynamic, single-page apps).
    - **React Router** for routing.
    - **Axios** or **Fetch API** for making HTTP requests to the backend.
    - **State management**: Use Redux or React's Context API for managing global state (e.g., user authentication status).
    - **Styling**: Use CSS frameworks like **Tailwind CSS** or **Material-UI** for consistent and responsive design.
    - **Form Handling**: Libraries like Formik or React Hook Form for handling form submissions (especially for login, registration, and blog posts).

### **Back-End**:

1. **Node.js with Express** or **Python (Flask/Django)**:
    - Express is a popular lightweight framework for Node.js, while Django provides more out-of-the-box features if you prefer Python.
    - **RESTful APIs**: Build REST APIs to handle CRUD operations for blog posts, comments, and user management.
    - **JWT Authentication** for secure user login and session management.
    - **Authorization middleware** for role-based access control.

### **Database**:

1. **Relational DB (PostgreSQL/MySQL)** or **NoSQL DB (MongoDB)**:
    - **PostgreSQL/MySQL**: Use a relational database for structured data like blog posts, users, and comments.
    - **MongoDB**: If you want to go the NoSQL route, MongoDB is great for storing blog posts and user data in a flexible, schema-less manner.
    - Implement relationships (e.g., users and their blog posts, posts and their comments) using foreign keys (in relational DB) or references (in MongoDB).

### **Authentication**:

1. **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** or **OAuth**:
    - Use JWT for stateless authentication, storing tokens in localStorage/sessionStorage or cookies.
    - Alternatively, integrate with **OAuth** for social login (Google, GitHub, Facebook, etc.).

### **Cloud Storage for Media**:

1. **AWS S3**, **Google Cloud Storage**, or **Cloudinary**:
    - Use cloud services to store media files (e.g., images or avatars) associated with blog posts or user profiles.
    - Ensure your app allows users to upload and display images in their blog posts.

### **Deployment**:

1. **Docker**:
    - Containerize your app with Docker for consistent development and deployment.
2. **CI/CD Pipelines**:
    - Set up CI/CD pipelines using **GitHub Actions**, **GitLab CI**, or **CircleCI** to automate tests, builds, and deployments.
3. **Cloud Hosting**:
    - Use **Heroku**, **AWS EC2**, **Google Cloud Run**, or **Azure** for deployment.
    - Ensure you use a proper **domain** and set up **HTTPS** for secure communication.

### Advanced Features to Make Your Blog App Stand Out:

1. **Real-Time Features**:
    - Use **WebSockets** or **Firebase Realtime Database** to allow real-time comments, notifications, or chat (for example, users can receive notifications when someone comments on their post).
2. **Post Analytics**:
    - Show analytics for blog posts (e.g., number of views, likes, or comments).
    - Add an **admin dashboard** where admins can view statistics on the number of posts, user activity, etc.
3. **Content Moderation**:
    - Implement a flagging system for inappropriate content.
    - Allow admins to moderate content (approve or reject posts/comments).
4. **SEO Optimization**:
    - Optimize the application for SEO (using **Next.js** or **Nuxt.js** for server-side rendering can help).
    - Generate meta tags, structured data (JSON-LD), and sitemaps to improve visibility on search engines.
5. **Mobile App**:
    - Convert your blog app into a **React Native** mobile app (or use **Flutter**) for cross-platform development, allowing users to write, read, and comment on posts via a mobile interface.
6. **Cache Optimization**:
    - Use **Redis** for caching frequently requested blog posts or queries.
    - Implement pagination or infinite scroll to handle large datasets efficiently.
7. **Internationalization**:
    - Make your app support multiple languages (if applicable) by using libraries like **i18next** for React or Vue.js.

### Potential Enhancements (Optional):

- **Monetization**: Add features like advertisements (Google AdSense) or a subscription model (allow users to subscribe for premium content).
- **SEO**: Implement Server-Side Rendering (SSR) with **Next.js** (React) or **Nuxt.js** (Vue) to improve SEO for individual blog posts.

### Key Skills Demonstrated:

- **Frontend**: React.js/Vue.js, responsive design, state management, forms, routing, API integration.
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express or Django, RESTful APIs, authentication, authorization, CRUD operations, real-time updates.
- **Database Design**: PostgreSQL/MySQL or MongoDB, relationships, and data models.
- **Deployment & DevOps**: Docker, CI/CD, cloud services (AWS/GCP/Azure), domain setup, and SSL.
- **Security**: Implementing proper authentication/authorization, password hashing (e.g., bcrypt), and securing APIs.

### Conclusion:

A **Blog Full-Stack Application** is a great way to showcase your ability to develop both front-end and back-end systems while also demonstrating your understanding of important concepts like authentication, security, database management, and cloud deployment. It’s a project that can be made as simple or complex as you want, depending on the features and technologies you choose to implement. By adding advanced features like real-time collaboration, SEO optimization, and cloud storage, you can further impress recruiters at top tech companies like Google and Microsoft.

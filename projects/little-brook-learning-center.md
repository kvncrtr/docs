# Tech Stack

### **1. Frontend (Client-Side)**
**Technologies:**
- **React.js**: A highly efficient library for building interactive UIs, with support for component-based architecture and virtual DOM for performance.  
- **SCSS (SASS)**: For maintainable and scalable styling.  
- **TypeScript**: Adds type safety to JavaScript, reducing runtime errors.  

**Why?**  
- Optimized rendering for SEO and fast user experience.
- Scalable and maintainable codebase with reusable components.  

### **2. Backend (Server-Side)**
**Technologies:**
- **Golang**: For computationally heavy tasks like AI-powered progress tracking or compliance automation. Golang is known for its performance and scalability.  
- **GraphQL**: For efficient data querying and flexibility in fetching data for various features.  

**Why?**  
- Node.js provides real-time communication and fast API responses.  
- Golang ensures high performance and concurrency for scaling.  

### **3. Database**
**Technologies:**
- **PostgreSQL**: A relational database ideal for handling complex queries, ensuring ACID compliance, and scaling with features like partitioning and replication.  
- **Redis**: For caching frequently accessed data like live stream configurations or daily schedules, improving performance.  

**Why?**  
- PostgreSQL supports complex relationships, ensuring data integrity for features like parent portals and child tracking.  
- Redis improves performance for high-traffic data.  

### **4. Cloud Infrastructure**
**Technologies:**
- **AWS**: Offers scalable services like EC2 (compute), RDS (managed databases), S3 (storage for media files), and CloudFront (CDN for fast content delivery).  
- **Docker & Kubernetes**: For containerization and orchestration, enabling easy scaling and deployment of microservices.  
- **Serverless Framework**: Use AWS Lambda for event-driven functionalities like notifications or real-time updates.  

**Why?**  
- AWS provides reliable and scalable solutions to handle large-scale traffic and storage.  
- Docker and Kubernetes make scaling microservices easier.  

### **5. Real-Time Communication**
**Technologies:**
- **Socket.IO**: For real-time communication like live streaming or messaging.  
- **Firebase Realtime Database**: For real-time features like notifications or chat.  

**Why?**  
- Socket.IO ensures efficient, real-time updates between the server and clients.  
- Firebase is ideal for lightweight, real-time data syncing.  

### **6. AI/ML Features**
**Technologies:**
- **Python (with TensorFlow/PyTorch)**: For training and deploying AI models like child progress tracking or automated compliance tools.  
- **FastAPI**: For serving machine learning models as APIs.  

**Why?**  
- Python’s extensive libraries make it the best choice for AI/ML development.  
- FastAPI is lightweight and fast for serving models.  

### **7. Security**
**Technologies:**
- **OAuth 2.0**: For secure authentication, enabling features like single sign-on (SSO).  
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For stateless, secure session management.  
- **SSL/TLS**: For encrypting all data in transit.  

**Why?**  
- These ensure data security, especially for sensitive information like children’s health records or payment details.  

### **8. DevOps and CI/CD**
**Technologies:**
- **GitHub Actions**: For continuous integration and deployment pipelines.  
- **Terraform**: For infrastructure as code (IaC) to automate cloud infrastructure setup.  
- **Prometheus & Grafana**: For monitoring and performance metrics.  

**Why?**  
- CI/CD ensures seamless deployment and updates.  
- Terraform and monitoring tools make scaling predictable and manageable.  

### **9. Content Delivery**
**Technologies:**
- **Contentful/Strapi**: Headless CMS for managing dynamic content like blogs, testimonials, and activity calendars.  
- **Cloudflare**: For CDN and DDoS protection.  

**Why?**  
- A headless CMS makes it easy to manage and deliver content dynamically.  
- Cloudflare ensures fast and secure delivery.  

### **10. Third-Party Integrations**
- **Twilio**: For SMS notifications and parent communication.  
- **Stripe**: For secure payment processing.  
- **Zoom API**: For virtual parent-teacher meetings or workshops.  

### **11. Scalability Best Practices**
- **Microservices Architecture**: Divide the app into smaller, independently deployable services (e.g., enrollment, child tracking, and parent communication).  
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Add more servers to handle increasing traffic.  
- **Load Balancers**: Use AWS Elastic Load Balancing to distribute traffic evenly.
